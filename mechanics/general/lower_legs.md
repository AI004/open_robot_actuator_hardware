# Lower Legs
## Description
<img src="images/lower_legs_1.jpg" width="500"><br>*Lower Legs - different versions*

* we have been using different lower leg versions for our quadruped robots
* the lower leg length and the foot diameter is identical for all the versions
* the distance between the center of the knee and the center of the foot is 160mm
* the foot diameter including the bicycle tyre is 34mm
* all the lower legs have the same [mechanical interface](conventions.md#mechanical-interface-actuator-modules) and are interchangeable
* the different lower leg versions are described below
* the foot surface is lined with a piece of thin bicycle tire
* the [preparation of the lower legs](#preparing-the-lower-legs) is also described below

## Lower Leg v3
<img src="images/lower_leg_v3_1.jpg" width="400"><br>*Lower Leg v3 - weight: 22g each*

* this version is intended for solid printing on a SLS or FDM printer
* [STL file Lower Leg v3](stl_files/lower_leg_v3.STL)
* bicycle tire dimensions: 7mm x 75mm
* bicycle tire weight: 2g

## Lower Leg v2
<img src="images/lower_leg_v2_1.jpg" width="400"><br>*Lower Leg v2 - weight: 22g each*

* this version is intended for printing on a Fortus FDM printer with "sparse double dense" printer setting

## Lower Leg v1
<img src="images/lower_leg_v1_1.jpg" width="400"><br>*Lower Leg v1 - weight: 32g each*

* this version is a **placeholder** for the [lower leg with foot contact switch](../foot_contact_switch_v1/README.md#foot-contact-switch-v1)
* it has the same outer dimensions as the lower leg with foot contact switch
* it also has a similar weight when printed on a Fortus FDM printer with "sparse double dense" printer setting
* [STL file Lower Leg v1](stl_files/lower_leg_v1.STL)
* bicycle tire dimensions: 10mm x 75mm
* bicycle tire weight: 3g

## Lower Leg with Foot Contact Switch

<img src="images/lower_leg_contact_switch_1.jpg" width="400"><br>*Lower Leg for Foot Contact Switch - weight with electronics: 35g*

* the lower leg with foot contact switch is described here: [Foot Contact Switch Documentation](../foot_contact_switch_v1/README.md#foot-contact-switch-v1)

## Preparing the Lower Legs

<img src="images/lower_leg_preparation_1.jpg" width="300"><br>*Increase the size of the through holes with a 3mm drill bit if required.*

<img src="images/lower_leg_preparation_2.jpg" width="300"><br>*If the lower legs have been printed on a FDM printer there might be beads on the surfaces.<br>The bead on the rectangular interface can cause problems later when the lower leg is installed.<br>Remove the bead on the rectangular interface surface with a sharp tool.*

<img src="images/lower_leg_preparation_3.jpg" width="350"><br>*Use scissors to cut the bicycle tire into rectangular segments.<br>We use the center part of a Schwalbe Lugano 28" 23-622 tire.*

<img src="images/lower_leg_preparation_4.jpg" width="300"><br>*Clean the bonding surfaces with ethanol.*<br>

<img src="images/lower_leg_preparation_5.jpg" width="300"><br>*We use a pin to secure the tire during bonding.<br>Place the tire on the foot and line it up.<br>Push a pin through the tire into the 3d printed part.<br>Make sure that you can see a mark from the pin.*<br>

<img src="images/lower_leg_preparation_6.jpg" width="300"><br>*Heat the pin up with a lighter.<br>Push the pin 2mm or 3mm into the 3d printed lower leg.<br>Use the location that was marked before.*<br>

<img src="images/lower_leg_preparation_7.jpg" width="300"><br>*The lower leg is now prepared for bonding.*<br>

<img src="images/lower_leg_preparation_8.jpg" width="300"><br>*Apply a thin layer of Loctite 406 onto the surface of the tire.*<br>

<img src="images/lower_leg_preparation_9.jpg" width="300"><br>*Place the tire around the foot and secure it with a tape.<br>Wait for 30 minutes - remove the tape and the pin.*<br>

<img src="images/lower_leg_preparation_10.jpg" width="300"><br>*Cut off the ends of the tire horizontally.*<br>

<img src="images/lower_leg_preparation_11.jpg" width="400"><br>*The lower leg is now ready for installation.*<br>

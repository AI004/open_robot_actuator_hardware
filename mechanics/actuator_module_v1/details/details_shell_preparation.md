## Description
*  this page describes how to prepare the shells for the brushless actuator modules
* the shell assembly consists of two parts (the shell base and the shell cover) which are connected by eight M2,5 screws
* the flatness of the 3d printed parts and the diameters of the through holes is verified  [-> Checking the 3D Printed Shells](#checking-the-3d-printed-shells)
* the metric threads are cut with a M3 tap [-> Cutting the Metric Threads](#cutting-the-metric-threads)
* the threaded inserts are installed [-> Installing the Helicoil Inserts](#installing-the-helicoil-inserts)
* the bearing seats are checked and adjusted if required [-> Adjusting the Bearing Seats](#adjusting-the-bearing-seats)
* the roller bearings for the output shaft and the transmission shafts are installed [-> Installing the Bearings](#installing-the-bearings)
* the shell base and shell cover are assembled with eight M2,5 screws [-> Test-Mounting the Shells](#test-mounting-the-shells)

## Checking the 3D Printed Shells

<img src="../images/shell_preparation_0_1.jpg" width="300"> <br>*Place the shell cover on a flat surface and visually check the flatness of the part.*

<img src="../images/shell_preparation_0_2.jpg" width="300"> <br>*Place the planar area of the shell base on a flat surface and visually check the flatness of the part.<br>If the parts are warped they might not be usable.*

<img src="../images/shell_preparation_0_1.png" width="400"> <br>*There are two 3mm and eight 2,5mm through holes in the shell parts.<br>Check the diameter of the through holes with a caliper or by inserting a M3 and M2,5 screw.<br>If the hole diameters are too small and the screws don't pass through easily increase the hole diameter with a drill.*

## Cutting the Metric Threads

<img src="../images/shell_preparation_1_3.jpg" width="300"> <br>*Use a M3 tap to manually cut the threads in the locations shown below.<br>The picture shows different tool holders that can be used.*

<img src="../images/shell_preparation_1_1.png" width="400"> <br>*Use a M3 tap to cut the threads for the encoder mount and the belt tensioners.<br>Try to hold the tap as vertical as possible.<br>
Cut the threads all the way through the shell*

<img src="../images/shell_preparation_1_4.jpg" width="300"> <br>*Use the M3 tap to cut the two threads for the encoder attachment.*

<img src="../images/shell_preparation_1_5.jpg" width="300"> <br>*Use the M3 tap to cut the two threads for the timing belt tensioners.*

## Installing the Helicoil Inserts
<img src="../images/shell_preparation_2_1.jpg" width="300"> <br>*Helicoil Tools M2,5 - Tap, tang-break-off tool and insertion tool*

* we use Helicoil threaded inserts for increased stability
* you need the 3 special Helicoil tools shown in the picture above for each size
* for the actuator modules we use threaded inserts with the sizes M2,5 and M3
* try to hold the tap drill as vertical as possible
* stop tapping when you reach the bottom of the hole and the resistance increases <br>(the threads in the 3d printed parts can strip easily)

<img src="../images/shell_preparation_2_1.png" width="400"> <br>*In the next step the M2,5 Helicoils are installed in the locations shown above.*

<img src="../images/shell_preparation_2_2.jpg" width="300"> <br>*Shell Base: Tap the 4 holes with the M2,5 Helicoil tap.*

<img src="../images/shell_preparation_2_3.jpg" width="300"> <br>*Shell Base: Install four M2,5 x 3,75mm Helicoils using the installation tool.<br>Remove the tangs using the tang break-off tool.<br>Make sure that the tangs don't stay inside of the part.*

## 2dof Leg - Hip FE Module

* the Hip FE actuator module for the 2dof legs is an **exception**
* for all the other actuator modules ignore this step and continue below  [-> Adjusting the Bearing Seats](#adjusting-the-bearing-seats)
* the Hip FE actuator modules for the 2dof leg require two extra M3 helicoil inserts for the second anchor point
* the 2dof leg is used for the [8dof Quadruped Robot](../../quadruped_robot_8dof_v1#quadruped-robot-8dof-v1) and the [Leg Test Stand](../../leg_test_stand_v1#leg-test-stand-v1)

## Adjusting the Bearing Seats

<img src="../images/shell_preparation_3_1.png" width="500"> <br>*The bearing seats are marked yellow in this screenshot.*


* The tolerances of the 3d printed parts can vary quite a bit depending on the printing technology, the printer settings and the material.
* There should be a light press-fit between the bearing seats and the bearings.
* You should be able to install and remove the bearings manually with moderate force.
* If the bearing seats are too tight they have to be adjusted to the right size.
* For that we use end mills with a sharp 90 degree edge
* We don't recommend to use reamers, because they are typically chamfered and won't produce a sharp corner.
* You should dull the blades on the bottom with a file - such that the end mills remove material on the sides only.

## Installing the Bearings

<img src="../images/shell_preparation_4_1.jpg" width="300"> <br>*Stainless steel roller bearings.<br> Two output bearings: 32mm x 25mm x 4mm<br>Three transmission bearings: 8mm x 4mm x 2mm*

<img src="../images/shell_preparation_4_1.png" width="450"> <br>*Bearing locations for the shell base and shell cover.*

<img src="../images/shell_preparation_4_4.jpg" width="300"> <br>*Place the transmission bearings on the shell and push them in with your fingers.<br>Try to keep the bearing horizontal while installing it.*

<img src="../images/shell_preparation_4_5.jpg" width="300"> <br>*You can also use the 3d printed tool for bonding the code wheels.<br>[ -> Tool Code Wheel Bonding](../stl_files/tool_code_wheel_bonding.STL)*

## Test-Mounting the Shells

<img src="../images/shell_preparation_3_2.png" width="400"> <br>*The shell parts are connected by eight screws.*

<img src="../images/shell_preparation_3_1.jpg" width="300"> <br>*Stainless steel socket head cap screws for connecting the shells.<br> Five M2,5x6 and three M2,5x10 screws are required.*

<img src="../images/shell_preparation_3_2.jpg" width="300"> <br>*Install the four M2,5x6 socket head cap screws on the cover.<br>You will need a 2mm hex driver. Turn the shell around.*

<img src="../images/shell_preparation_3_3.jpg" width="300"> <br>*Install three M2,5x10 screws and one M2,5x6 screw on the base shell.*

<img src="../images/shell_preparation_3_4.jpg" width="400"> <br>*The shell is now fully prepared and ready for assembly.<br>Weight of the actuator module shell assembly: 61g*
